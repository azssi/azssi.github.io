Odie and his best friend Irene are two outsiders who find a second home in the Philippine underground music scene. The two decide to form a band and put together an unlikely crew that consists of the school bully, an ex-punk-turned-barista, and a former-childstar-turned-band-manager. The film follows their misadventures as they face satanic S&M bands, samurai swindlers, narcissistic rockstars, the pretentious Philippine art community and the freakiest music video auteur ever. Co-written by Diego Castillo, the guitarist of one of the Philippines' biggest rock bands SANDWICH, and directed by multi-awarded music video director Quark Henares, Rakenrol is a heartfelt ode to the underground scene both filmmakers spent their formative years in.
